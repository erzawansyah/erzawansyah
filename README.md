### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m M.E.W  

Iâ€™m a researcher, developer, and journalist with a passion for **critical narratives, AI, and Web3**. My journey started in journalism, leading me to **found Sediksi.com**, an alternative media platform. Over time, I expanded into **psychometrics, AI, and blockchain**, combining social science with technology.  

Currently, Iâ€™m finishing my masterâ€™s thesis in **psychology**, developing an AI-powered tool for generating psychological scales in Indonesian. On the tech side, I work with **Python, JavaScript (React, Node), and Solidity**, building projects like:  
- **StoryBadge Checker** for the Story Protocol testnet ([story.mew.xyz](https://story.mew.xyz))  
- AI-powered content tools & automation  
- GIS-based and election data systems  

Now, Iâ€™m diving deeper into **Web3 development**â€”learning **Solidity** and experimenting with **decentralized applications**. Always exploring, always building. ðŸš€
